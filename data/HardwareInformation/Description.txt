This folder contains data regarding the RAM and CPU usage information when running the same problem across three different machines with different RAM and CPU capabilities. 
A gridsize of 1000 x 1000 was chosen for all 3 machines using the same problem. 

CPU Specifications: Machine 1 and 2 have 8-thread CPUs and Machine 3 has a 16-thread CPU. Running the problem consumed the entirety of a single thread, such that Machines 1 and 2 had about 12.5% total CPU usage and Machine 3 had about 6.25% total CPU usage. 

RAM Specifications: Machine 1 was equipped with 16GiB of total RAM while Machines 2 and 3 were equipped with 32GiB of total RAM. The PEAK RAM Used was never close to exceeding the total availability of RAM, which suggests the RAM availability was not a limiting factor for this problem. However, this may change as we increase gridsize. 

Please see the ram-stats.xlsx and cpu-stats.xlsx for the summarized results.

NOTE: The RAM and CPU data were produced using the Benchmarking script described in the high-level README.md file. The user of this repository can reproduce these results for their specific machine following the protocol in the README.md file.
